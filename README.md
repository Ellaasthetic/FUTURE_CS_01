## Project Overview

This hands-on cybersecurity internship project involved a vulnerability assessment of a deliberately vulnerable web application—**Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)**. The project simulates real-world client work for startups and SaaS platforms seeking to secure their web applications.  

The objective was to discover and exploit common web vulnerabilities using ethical hacking tools and OWASP Top 10 standards, then compile a professional security assessment report.

## Tasks Performed

- Set up and explored the **DVWA** environment
- Configured **OWASP ZAP** and **FoxyProxy** for proxy-based interception
- Performed manual and automated vulnerability scans
- Identified and exploited vulnerabilities:
  - SQL Injection (SQLi)
  - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  - Brute Force Attack
- Mapped findings to the **OWASP Top 10**
- Documented each vulnerability with:
  - Screenshots and payloads
  - Impact severity (High / Medium)
  - Remediation advice

## Skills Gained

- Web Application Vulnerability Scanning  
- Security Documentation & Reporting  
- OWASP Top 10 Threat Mapping  
- Basic Ethical Hacking Techniques  
- Threat Modeling & Risk Analysis
